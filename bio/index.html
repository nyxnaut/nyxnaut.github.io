					<h2>Interests</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
							<p>I was introduced to climbing by a friend in college but I only
								started going full time after moving to New York. Its super hard
								and super fun! I love sharing my passion of the sport with others
								so shoot me a message and lets go climb! I train at
								<a href="https://www.gp-81.com">GP-81</a>.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Guitar</h3>
							<p>I am still <em>very</em> much a beginner, but I picked up my first
								electric guitar a few months ago and its been so much fun! Working
								through simple chord progressions, e.g. <em>Cosmic Dancer</em> by 
								T. Rex, but the secret dream is a Talking Heads cover band ha ha.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Coffee</h3>
							<p>A lot of people like coffee, but I am definitely a few deviations
							from the middle of that bell curve. I brew at home, and love to
							experiment with a lot of different devices: AeroPress, percolators, 
							fabric/metal/paper drips, moka pots, french-press, espresso, turkish
							... I have mostly narrowed it down to a v60, a french press and my
							pride and joy, an Elektra MicroCasa. The next goal is to finally
							upgrade from my Lido 2 manual grinder to something electric so that
							my morning coffee ritual does not have to come with an arm workout.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Crochet</h3>
							<p>This is another new hobby! A friend got me a crochet kit for the
							holidays and I just finished making my first basket. I already have
							that itch to make my friends a bunch of crochet clothing they do not
							want. Its awful, someone please save them (me).
