				<h2>Freelancer's Calendar</h2>
				<section class="project-description">
					<h3>The Google Calendar replacement you didn't know you needed (still w.i.p.)</h3>
					<p>This is my current project. I don't have the project page written yet so
					I have put the status and goals here. Its written in React, and uses
					a Node.js backend connected to a MongoDB instance. There are no class
					components, and a lot of hooks. Code viewable
					<a href="https://github.com/w-n-c/freelancers-calendar">here</a>, the live
					site is hosted <a href="https://w-n-c.dev">here</a> and an embed
					of the site may be found below.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="project-status">
					<h3>Current Status</h3>
					<p>The site is functional! You log in through google, create and
					manage events, then view them in weekly or monthly views.</p>
					<aside class="note">NOTE: I have a side goal of making my own web components for input,
					so I just put in a placeholder form for editing events. It assumes
					24hr time and YYYY/MM/DD formatted dates.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section class="project-goals">
					<h3>Goals</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h4>Reach feature parity with the core of Google Calendar</h4>
							<p>Right now, that means allowing users to have multiple calendars,
							the ability to share events/calendars with each other and a few additional
							calendar views.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Add features unique to the Freelancer's Calendar</h4>
							<p>The most important feature enhancement is the ability to set flexible
							calendar items, and move them as a group. With these features, a meeting
							can run long without making you want to throw your whole calendar away
							for the rest of the day.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Integration with other calendars (iCal/gCal)</h4>
							<p>Event importing/exporting is a given, but I'd like the ability to
							keep the calendars in sync. Research into API's and license agreements
							is necessary before moving forward.</p>
						</li>
